# Gourmet-restaurant-information-search
This is a small Python project through a web crawler and TKInter. We use a web crawler to grab the food list of a designated county and city from the ifoodie website, and then use TKInter to display the captured data with a graphical interface.

This project is to grab the food list of Guishan. If you want to grab the food list of other counties and cities, just modify the "base_url" in the code.
